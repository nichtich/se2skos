      "body" : "<p>A log file is a file which is generated by a software process to record some specific details (events) about the workings of this process. Most logfiles are plain, human-readable text files, some however are using a binary format to conserve space and need specific treatment for post-processing. (Example: Unix login history in <code>utmp</code>/<code>wtmp</code> format)</p>\n\n<p>A log file can be categorized into several types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Access log which records information related to the usage of the service provided by this process.</li>\n<li>Error log which records error conditions.</li>\n<li>Info/Debug log which records more detailed information as compared with other logs.</li>\n<li>Transaction log to document a chain of events, this often is required to be immutable to avoid later tampering.</li>\n<li><code>redo logs</code>, containing the complete information to replay a chain of actions, often used where incomplete data transactions would lead to inconsistent data, for example in file systems or databases.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The main two goals of creating and maintaining log files are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Finding and debugging problems.</li>\n<li>Gathering usage information.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Depending on the frequence of events and the level of detail, logfiles may be growing very quickly, and usually require a strategy for managing their growth. </p>\n",
